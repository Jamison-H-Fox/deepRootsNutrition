    text: [`Optimize your health and hormones through Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis. &!&    Are you tired of chasing symptoms only to end up back where you started? Tired of buying supplements and hoping they help, only to find that they did nothing or even made your symptoms worse? &!&   Take the guesswork out of your health journey and learn what it is your body actually needs. &!&   I use blood chemistry analysis to assess nutritional status, inflammation, immune balance, hormonal status, kidney, liver and gut status and much more.  From this information we'll create an individualized nutrition plan that is specific to your body and its needs.`,
    `Did you know that minerals are critical to optimal health? &!&   They are often referred to as the “spark plugs” of the body.  They are necessary for enzyme reactions, nutrient transfer, nerve conduction and much more. &!&  The body cannot make its own minerals, so we have to obtain them from our diet.  Unfortunately, most Americans have chronically low mineral levels. &!& This can create a cascade of imbalances and symptoms in the body.  By addressing micronutrient and mineral deficiencies we can give the body what it needs to perform optimally.`,
    `Helping women prepare their body for pregnancy and postpartum is at the center of my passion as a Nutritional Therapist. &!& Pre conception work is something that every women should be doing. Growing a baby takes a lot of nutrients and resources from our body. Attention to perinatal nutrition supports the growth of your child and influences their long term health. &!&  Our bodies will do all that they can to nourish our growing baby, but what if the nutrients simply aren’t there to give? If we don’t prioritize our nutrition before and during pregnancy both mom and baby can be left depleted. &!&  Ideally it is best to start preparing your body for pregnancy several months before you are ready to conceive.  I work with women for 6+ months prior to trying for conception.  During those 6 months we individualize a nutrition plan that is optimal for you and your body based on Blood Chemistry Analysis, HTMA, and an extensive Nutritional Assessment. &!&   From there we will meet together several times over the course of 6 months to help you feel confident and prepared as you start your pregnancy journey. &!& Book a free discovery call to see if this is a right fit for you on your journey to pregnancy.`,
    `Postpartum is a sacred and beautiful time but it can also be a time of loneliness, exhaustion, depression, anxiety and burn out. As a mother you have been pushed to your limits mentally, physically and emotionally during pregnancy and then again during the months following the birth of your child. Your body is burnt out in many areas and needs some love, nurturing and deep nourishment.&!&Working with many women through the years I have seen a great need for more support in those months following the birth of a child. I believe that our bodies are always doing the best that they can but often after pregnancy and birth they are left depleted and exhausted. &!&I help women to find the areas that their body needs more support and together we work to bring the body back into balance.  By supporting the foundations of happy hormones and micronutrient balance the body is often able to find homeostasis.  This can help naturally improve symptoms the new mother may be facing.&!&If you are a mother who doesn’t feel like your self and you feel lost on where to start, please book a free discovery call so that we can discuss supportive options for you.`
